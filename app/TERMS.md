PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THESE STORAGE SHARING TERMS CAREFULLY. NOTE THAT SECTION 15 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.

By installing the Software (defined below), you agree to be bound by these Storage Sharing Terms and all terms incorporated by reference.

Storj Labs Inc. (“**Company**”) provides online storage services (“**Storage Services**”) to its users that enable users to store data and other materials (“**Storage Materials**”) via a distributed network of independently operated devices (“**Devices**”). Each Device communicates with the Storage Services via open source software (“**Software**”) that is installed on the Device. The Software enables a Device to rent extra storage space (“**Space**”) available on the Device to Company or directly to other third parties. Company may use the Space it rents from you or may re-rent the Space it rents from you to other users via the Storage Services.

These Storage Sharing Terms provide the terms pursuant to which you may rent Space to Company in connection with your use of the Software on any Device. The Software may also permit you to rent Space directly to others, but these Storage Sharing Terms will not apply to those transactions. If you never rent any Space to Company, only Sections 1 and 2 of these Storage Sharing Terms will apply to you.

Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://storj.io/privacy-policy.html) for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.

You and Company agree as follows:

    (c) By running the Software on your Devices and allowing Space to be utilized by Company and its users, you understand that your Devices may be impacted due to the additional constraints being placed on them by the Software and the processing of Storage Materials. In particular, your Devices may not operate as quickly as they would without running the Software and making Space available for others to utilize.

15.  #### Dispute Resolution; Arbitration

    PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.

    1.  #### Binding Arbitration

        Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “**Disputes**”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company (a) waive your and Company's respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Storage Sharing Terms resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and Company's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

    2.  #### No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions

        Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Storage Sharing Terms is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

    3.  #### Federal Arbitration Act

        These Storage Sharing Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “**FAA**”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

    4.  #### Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution

        Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Company will be sent by e-mail to Company at hello@storj.io. Notice to you will be by email to any email address you have provided to us. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 15, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 15.1, file a claim in court.

    5.  #### Process

        Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.

    6.  #### Authority of Arbitrator

        As limited by the FAA, these Storage Sharing Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Storage Sharing Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

    7.  #### Rules of JAMS

        The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the [JAMS website](www.jamsadr.com/). By agreeing to be bound by these Storage Sharing Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.

16.  #### Governing Law and Venue

    These Storage Sharing Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out or relating to these Storage Sharing Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.

17.  #### Severability

    If any term, clause or provision of these Storage Sharing Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Storage Sharing Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Storage Sharing Terms.

18.  #### Amendment

    We reserve the right to change these Storage Sharing Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we make changes to the Storage Sharing Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by posting the revised Storage Sharing Terms to the Software and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Storage Sharing Terms. Your continued sharing or rental of Space to Company will confirm your acceptance of the revised Storage Sharing Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Storage Sharing Terms, you must stop interacting with the Storage Services via the Software.

19.  #### Survival

    The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Storage Sharing Terms: all defined terms and Sections 10 - 17, and 19 - 20.

20.  #### Miscellaneous

    The Storage Sharing Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Company relating to the subject matter of this agreement. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Storage Sharing Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Storage Sharing Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, the Storage Sharing Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
